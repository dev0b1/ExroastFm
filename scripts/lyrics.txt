1. petty-breakup
[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Ahem
Lemme clear my throat
This for my ex... and his new ting

[Verse 1]
Remember ramen days?
Sharing one pack
Now you fine dining
On her daddy's stack?
Cheapskate move, bro
I ain't even mad
Just peeped her Insta
Your new girl is sad!

[Pre-Chorus]
Word on the street, you sprung
Guess her daddy got the funds

[Chorus]
You upgraded side piece
Downgraded standards
Swapped a queen for pawn
Loser's gambit, fam
You upgraded side piece
Downgraded standards
Now you stuck with her
While I'm blowing up, damn!

[Verse 2]
She rock designer
But that weave is tragic
You traded loyalty
For a plastic fantastic
Hope that sugar daddy
Keep your pockets fat
'Cause your career moves?
Boy, they straight up wack

[Chorus]
You upgraded side piece
Downgraded standards
Swapped a queen for pawn
Loser's gambit, fam
You upgraded side piece
Downgraded standards
Now you stuck with her
While I'm blowing up, damn!






[Chorus]
Vanished faster than promises
Went ghost, Casper, total bogus
Poof, you gone, like a bad toupee in wind
Shoulda known, you a zero, pretend





2. ghosted-diss
[Verse 1]
Remember them nights, talkin' 'bout forever?
Now you duckin' my calls, whatever
See you out with Becky, rockin' that fake flex
I ain't even mad, I'm onto the next
Word

[Prechorus]
Thought you were a dime, nah, more like a penny
Heads up, worthless, ghosted plenty

[Verse 2]
Your game weaker than gas station coffee
Shoulda seen the signs, I was too damn goofy
Now you chasin' clout, pathetic try-hard
I'm laughin' to the bank, playin' my own card

[Chorus]
Vanished faster than promises
Went ghost, Casper, total bogus
Poof, you gone, like a bad toupee in wind
Shoulda known, you a zero, pretend




[Verse]
You're like a pizza burn
On the roof of my mouth
I hate you
But you are so average
I can't even hate you enough

[Prechorus]
(Female Vocal)
I wish I could quit you
But you are my nicotine
You are my bad habit
You are the worst thing

[Chorus]
(Male Vocal)
You're a walking red flag
You're a walking red flag
A certified walking red flag
And I knew it

[Verse 2]
(Female Vocal)
You are like that stain
On my favorite shirt
You won't leave
You are like my student loans
I can't shake you

[Prechorus]
(Male Vocal)
I wish I could forget you
But you're stuck in my head
You're a bad song
You are a mess

[Chorus]
(Female Vocal)
You're a walking red flag
You're a walking red flag
A certified walking red flag
And I knew it

3.savage-confidence

[Verse 1]
You got a PhD in gaslight science
Majored in lies
Minored in defiance
Your ego's so big it needs a ZIP code
But your bank account screams "low-budget mode"

[Prechorus]
Mirror
Mirror
You check it twice
Who's the clown? Oh
What a surprise
Your charm expired
It’s out of stock
Guess what? You’re the joke
Not the shock

[Chorus]
Certified walking red flag
You’re the reason karma carries a bag
Certified walking red flag
Even your shadow throws you a drag

[Verse 2]
Your playlist? All breakup anthems
Bro
But we both know you’re the problem
Though
Swipe left
Right
But love won’t stick
Your bio’s a novel of narcissistic tricks

[Prechorus]
Mirror
Mirror
It’s cracked in two
One for me
One reflecting you
No magic left
No spell to cast
The clown show’s over
It went too fast

[Chorus]
Certified walking red flag
You’re the reason karma carries a bag
Certified walking red flag
Even your shadow throws you a drag



4.Healing journey
[Verse]
You said I’d never make it past your shadow
Guess what
I’m bathing in my own glow
Every wound you left became my gold
While you're chasing ghosts in stories old

[Prechorus]
Same old script
Same bad lines
Rewind the tape
You’re stuck in time

[Chorus]
I’m thriving while you’re stuck
In your red-flag rerun rut
I’m the glow-up you can’t touch
Oh
Thriving while you’re stuck

[Verse 2]
You’re a broken record
I’m a new song
I hit the charts while you’re still wrong
All your drama’s reruns on repeat
I’m living rent-free
Isn’t that sweet

[Bridge]
You spin your wheels
I’m flying high
You’re a bad tattoo I left behind
Here’s to me
The one who won
Thriving
While you’re stuck and done

[Chorus]
I’m thriving while you’re stuck
In your red-flag rerun rut
I’m the glow-up you can’t touch
Oh
Thriving while you’re stuck



5.self-love-anthem
[Verse]
You said I’d fade like a cheap tattoo
But look at me now I’m a better view
Neon glow I’m the skyline’s queen
While you’re stuck on yesterday’s scene

[Prechorus]
Oh you thought I’d break thought I’d fall apart
But I turned my cracks into modern art

[Chorus]
Better brighter—you’re basic and bitter
Glow so strong it’ll fry your dimmer
Level up while you stay stuck
I’m the sunrise you’re a burned-out truck

[Bridge]
Sip my shine while you spill that tea
My upgrade’s louder than your jealousy
Better brighter—you’re basic and bitter
Catch me rising I’m a heavy-hitter



6.[Verse]
Caught you sliding in my DMs, typing "Hey stranger,"
Thought I’d ghost you back, but nah—I'm a game-changer.
Your life's a sitcom, canceled mid-season,
I’m the Emmy-winning reboot, stealing the reason.
Still rocking that haircut? Yikes, 2012 called,
Your swag’s expired, like milk that’s uninstalled.

[Prechorus]
You peaked at prom, I'm the after-party,
Glow-up so strong, paparazzi sorry.

[Chorus]
You're the plot twist nobody wanted—
I'm the glow-up sequel, undaunted.
Mock my past? Nah, I flaunt it,
Came back better, now I haunt it.

[Verse 2]
Remember that mixtape you made, all Drake tracks?
Had me crying, but now I laugh at those playback cracks.
Tried to flex your ride, but it’s rust and duct tape,
Meanwhile, I’m pulling up, top-down, first place.
Messy as your room, left socks on the floor,
Now I’m on a yacht, not a care anymore.

[Bridge]
TikTok saw it first, now the world’s on my vibe,
Glow-up chronicles, yeah, I’m certified.
Your new girl’s my copy, but bootleg cheap,
While I’m champagne, you’re flat cola asleep.

[Chorus]
You're the plot twist nobody wanted—
I'm the glow-up sequel, undaunted.
Mock my past? Nah, I flaunt it,
Came back better, now I haunt it.
